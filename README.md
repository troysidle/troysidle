# Hello I'm Troy Sidle.

## As a developer, I’m building on skills obtained with my degree in computer science.

### For several years I worked professionally in the hospitality industry, specifically with craft cocktails. While living in New York City for the past 12 years, I’ve opened bars, consulted for big name brands and have recipes published in several cocktail books.

### I’m now pursuing software full time again and my current project is developing my personal website www.honeydewlimeade.com.

### You can follow along with the journey on Medium.
